CMS
===
It's simple CMS which I did from scratch and it has basic functions:
1. create, update and delete articles
2. create and update users profile
3. list of articles
4. list of users
5. crop picture

## Install
1. Clone repository ``git clone https://github.com/ste7/CMS``
2. Create database ``cmsdb``
3. Import database ``CMS/cmsdb.sql``

## Admin dashboard
Open http://localhost/CMS/login.php
* Username: ``Admin123``
* Password: ``admin123``
